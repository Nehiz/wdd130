            <p>Hello, my name is Nehikhare Efehi and I am a BYU pathway student from Nigeria. I am a rookie web developer. 
                I love this opportunity given to me by Heavenly 
                Father to learn and work towards becoming an expert computer programmer and web developer. Before my advent into tech, I used to work as a biological scientist due to 
                my first and second degrees being in the biological sciences, specifically, biochemistry and molecular biology. I have valuable wet-lab skills and experiences. My ultimate goal is to be able to 
                apply my tech skills to solve biologically related problems.</p>

            <p>Edo State is a state located in the southern part of Nigeria. It is most famous for being home to the great Benin kingdom, 
                the home of the binis or the Edo people as they are locally called. The Modern day Benin kingdom is most renowed for its monarcy system 
                with roots dating as far back as 1400. The Ancient Benin kingdom was among the first precolonial West Africa kingdoms to established trade
                route with the Europeans.</p>
