                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Whitewater Rafting, is a subsidiary of the parent company Whitewater Rafting, LLC based in Colorado River in Glenwood Spring,  
                USA. Whitewater Rafting, LLC has been in operation in USA since 1974. In 1998, a franchiseto operate in Nigeria was 
                granted and a branch was created and we moved to our current location atWhetgo Beach Guest House, Umutu riverfront in Delta State, 
                Nigeria.</p>
                <p>Thomas and Jenny Carter bought over the parent company at its early days and turned it into one of the adventure
                travel industryâ€™s trailblazers that it is today. Presently, cooker and Wendy Wendt, and George, are leading the company 
                as Group CEO, President and Regional Director respectively. Theyâ€™re dedicated to furthering the companyâ€™s commitment to 
                the preservation of wild places and creating meaningful outdoor experiences for our
                guestsâ€”values that have been at the core of Whitewater raftings for nearly five decades.
