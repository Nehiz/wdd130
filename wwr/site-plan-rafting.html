            <h2>Overview</h2>

            <h3>Purpose</h3>

White water rafting company want to make rafting adventure even better by bringing the water experience even closer to our clients bedside.

With us, you never regret water rafting.</p>
            <h3>Audience</h3>
            <p>Who are the target customers? My target customers are majorly foreigners and other out-of-state water rafting tourists who come in during the summer for water rafting adventures. Many of these tourists are working class with very tight schedules and usually have little or no time to start driving around town looking for good rafting locations. 
                What do they want? Most of these tourist want quick access to usable informations and also to be able to finalize all arranment before their trips. What are their needs that aren't being met? Currently, most of the rafting businesses do not have good online presence nor a 24 hours customers online service. So, many customers want to be able book or make changes to their bookings online, and also lodge complaints and get quick feed response to help them mak informed decisions.</p>
